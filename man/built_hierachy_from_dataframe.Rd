\title{Build Hierarchy from Taxonomy Dataframe for K-Anonymity}
\usage{
built_hierachy_from_dataframe(taxonomy)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxonomy}{A dataframe or matrix where each row represents a taxonomic path.
Non-NA and non-empty values are used to establish parent-child relationships.
The algorithm searches for consecutive non-empty entries in each row to determine these relationships.}
}
\value{
A list structure where each element represents a parent-child relationship in the generalization hierarchy.
Each element is named after the child concept and contains a list with a 'parent' element
identifying its parent concept (more general value).
}
\description{
This function transforms a taxonomy represented as a dataframe or matrix into a hierarchical structure
used for generalizing quasi-identifiers in k-anonymity implementations. Each row in the input represents
a path in the generalization hierarchy, with more specific values appearing in earlier columns and
their generalizations in subsequent columns.
